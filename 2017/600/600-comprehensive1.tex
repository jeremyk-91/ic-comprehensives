\noindent A couple of quick notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item I'd intend for the timelimit for this paper to be 3 hours and 20 minutes (200 minutes total).
\item This question was constructed by a student at Imperial College London, and is not intended to be representative of actual examination questions for any specific course at Imperial.
\item The material students have learned from the compulsory modules in first and second year should be sufficient to answer all questions.
\item Each question is worth 20 marks; the maximum mark is thus 100.
\end{itemize}
